          A Source Study is a publication, pre-publication, or unpublished study
          that contains one or more datasets selected for integration into the
          Atlas. Published or preprint studies are identified by their DOI.
          Given a DOI, the system queries CrossRef to retrieve basic study
          metadata, including authorship information. Unpublished source studies
          are identified by the author&apos;s name.
