          A Source Study is a publication (or pre-publication) containing one or
          more datasets selected for Atlas integration. Source studies are
          ingested into CELLxGENE as a &quot;CELLxGENE collection&quot; and into
          the HCA Data Repository and CAP as &quot;projects.&quot; A dataset is
          an AnnData file with a cell-by-gene count matrix and metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all of the datasets in a source study are necessarily integrated
          into a given atlas. The &quot;Datasets Used&quot; column indicates how
          many of the source studyâ€™s datasets are used in this atlas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select a source study and view its &quot;Datasets&quot; list to
          indicate which datasets are used in the atlas.
