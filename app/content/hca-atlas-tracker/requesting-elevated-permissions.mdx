# Requesting Elevated Permissions

All users are given read-only access to the HCA Atlas Tracker upon first signing in. If you are an integration lead and require edit access,
please email Ellen Todres at [etodres@humancellatlas.org](mailto:etodres@humancellatlas.org) to request the Integration Lead role. In your email please provide:

- Your full name.
- The Atlas(es) you work on as integration lead.
- The Gmail or Google Workspace backed email address that you intend to use to access the Atlas Tracker. A Google-backed email is required for this as
  the Tracker currently only supports Google as an authentication provider.
