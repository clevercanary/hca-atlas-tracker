# Requesting Access

Please email Ellen Todres at [etodres@humancellatlas.org](mailto:etodres@humancellatlas.org) to request access to the HCA Atlas Tracker. In your email please provide:

- Your full name.
- Your role in the project (e.g. Integration Lead or Network Coordinator).
- The Atlas(es) you work on.
- A Gmail or Google Workspace backed email address. This is required for access as the Tracker currently only supports Google as an authentication provider.
