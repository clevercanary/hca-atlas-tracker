# Requesting Access

Please email Ellen Todres at [etodres@humancellatlas.org](mailto:etodres@humancellatlas.org) to request access to the HCA Atlas Tracker. In your email please provide:

- Your full name
- The your role in the project, (e.g. Inetegration Lead or Network Coordinator)
- The Atlase(s) you work on
- A Gmail or Google Workspace backed email address. This is required for access as the Tracker currently only supports Google as an authentication provider.
